(Q) Write a python program to find the best of two test average marks out of three testâ€™s marks accepted from the user.
m1 = int(input("Enter the marks in the first test: "))
m2 = int(input("Enter the marks in the second test: "))
m3 = int(input("Enter the marks in the third test: "))
if m1 > m2:
 if m2 > m3:
 total = m1 + m2
 else:
 total = m1 + m3
elif m1 > m3:
 total = m1 + m2
else:
 total = m2 + m3
avg = total / 2
print("The average of the best two test marks is:", avg)


--> Output:
CASE 1:
Enter the marks in the first test: 20
Enter the marks in second test: 15
Enter the marks in third test: 22
The average of the best two test marks is: 21.0
CASE 2:
Enter the marks in the first test: 24
Enter the marks in second test: 25
Enter the marks in third test: 23
The average of the best two test marks is: 24.5
b) Develop a Python program to check whether a given
